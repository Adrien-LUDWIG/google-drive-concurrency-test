# Google Drive concurrency test

This repository enables to test Google Drive behavior
in the face of concurrent operations from two sites.

This is nothing fancy, simply three python scripts creating, renaming and deleting files
and folders.
But the use of scripts offers a reproduceable test with with little hand work,
so less human errors, and serves as reference of what was exactly tested.
